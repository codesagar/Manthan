Microsoft Azure SDK for Python
==============================

This is the Microsoft Azure bundle.

This package does not contain any code in itself. It installs a set
of packages that provide Microsoft Azure functionality.

All packages in this bundle have been tested with Python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4.


Features
========

This version of the Azure package bundle consists of the following
packages. Follow the links for more information on each package.

-  `azure-mgmt v0.20.1 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-mgmt/0.20.1>`__
-  `azure-servicebus v0.20.1 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicebus/0.20.1>`__
-  `azure-servicemanagement-legacy v0.20.1 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy/0.20.1>`__
